cv2 (OpenCV):
OpenCV is a popular open-source computer vision library.
It provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for image and video processing.
Used for tasks like capturing video from webcams, reading and writing image files, color space conversions, object detection, and more.
numpy:
NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Used here for numerical operations and array manipulation, such as flipping arrays along axes.
time:
The time module provides various time-related functions.
Used here to introduce a delay to allow the camera to warm up before capturing the background.



Import Libraries: It imports necessary libraries including cv2 (OpenCV), numpy (for numerical operations), and time.
Check OpenCV Version: Prints the version of OpenCV installed in the system.
Capture Video: Initializes video capture from the default camera (Webcam) and gives the camera some time to warm up.
Capture Background: Captures the background frame (without the object) by reading several frames and averaging them.
Define Color Range: Defines the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) range for the dark red color, which will be used to detect the cloak.
Main Loop: Continuously captures frames from the video feed and processes them.
Converts the frame from BGR (Blue-Green-Red) color space to HSV.
Creates a mask to isolate the dark red color (cloak) from the frame.
Refines the mask using morphological operations.
Generates the final output by combining the background and foreground (excluding the dark red color).
Displays the final output in a window named "INVISIBLE MAN".
Waits for the 'Esc' key to be pressed to exit the loop.
Release Resources: After the loop ends, it releases the video capture and closes all OpenCV windows.
